### Hello world microservice using CrowPHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as RequestInterface;
use Crow\Http\Server\Factory as CrowServer;

$app = CrowServer::create(CrowServer::SWOOLE_SERVER);
$router = Crow\Router\Factory::make();

$router->get('/', function (RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response) {
    $response->getBody()->write('Hello World');
    return $response;
});

$app->withRouter($router);

$app->listen(5005);
```
You may quickly test your newly built service as follows:
```bash
$ php index.php
```
Going to http://localhost:5005 will now display "Hello World".
